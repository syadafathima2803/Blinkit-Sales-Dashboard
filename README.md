# 🛒  Blinkit-Sales-Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze and visualize Blinkit’s retail sales performance—focusing on outlet growth, product trends, customer ratings, and location-based insights.

## 📌 Short Description / Purpose  

The Blinkit Retail Analytics Dashboard is a dynamic and business-focused Power BI report designed to explore sales performance across outlets, product categories, and city tiers.  
It helps stakeholders quickly understand **what’s driving revenue, where growth is happening, and which products perform best**, enabling smarter, data-driven decisions.

## 🛠 Tech Stack  

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
• 📊 **Power BI Desktop** – Main data visualization platform  
• 📂 **Power Query** – Data cleaning and transformation  
• 🧠 **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Calculated measures and KPIs  
• 🧩 **Data Modeling** – Relationships between sales, outlets, and product tables  
• 📁 **File Formats** – `.pbix` (development) and `.png` (preview images)  

## 📂 Data Source

The dataset includes:
- Outlet details (size, tier, establishment year, type)

The data is structured into related tables to enable cross-filtering and multi-dimensional analysis.
